## 💕 How to decor
  - Fork de Project 
    >see more in [How it works](#%EF%B8%8F-how-it-works)
   
  - Open the HTML file `index.html`
  - Start decorating your page
    > - hold left click to draw
    > - hold right click to erase
  - Download your draw file by clicking in `download` button
    > all draws can be saved, you can share your arts with your friend!
  - Put the file in the draws folder, you can find it in the project
  - To draw run the script: `npm run commit-draw "name-of-the-file"`
    > don't forget to add the `file extension`!
    
    > it will start to do the commits, you can sit and watch

## ⚙️ How it works
  - The Browse page was created to speedup the draws
    - it creates a `file` with your draw when you click in `download`
  - First the script will read a `file` with your draw
    - the file contains each `day` you paint and the `year` you choose
  - The `INTENSITY` value defines how much commits per day you gonna make
    > you cant change this value in the [commitDraw.js](https://github.com/gustavosiqueira2/git-decor/blob/main/src/services/commitDraw.js) file manually 
    : note : the process will take much longer
  - After that the script will proceed to `create, add, commit and push` the necessary changes in the corrects days
    > In the end of the day, you can do all of this by hand, the main purpose of this app is to create a user interface to facilitate all that work 😊
